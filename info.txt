exportPattern("^[[:alpha:]]+") is written which means all the functions are visible for now. 
Previously, it was export("Rcpp.fake.fun")




* checking package dependencies ... ERROR
Namespace dependency not required: ‘RcppEigen’
See section ‘The DESCRIPTION file’ in the ‘Writing R Extensions’
manual.

So RcppEigen is added in the description. 



removed all ~~ signs from symR-package.Rd 

Change the example part to something real



I can't make it simple enough. 




I will try Rcpp::compileAttributes now.

Trying put the data with 2D case. 
Then trying 3D. 



If anything goes wrong, try to remove all RcppExport type files (not makevars) in R/ and src/
Run  

cd symR; Rscript -e "Rcpp::compileAttributes()"; cd ..

R CMD build symR
R CMD check symR

2D is complete - but I don't know why the 3D LS is creating problem in devtools::check()

So I am trying to copy the 2D R function to 3D include file. 


I just copied and pasted the complete 2D case files and not the OSL/AECM. 
The result is the SAME -- I think they are creating problem as the 2D and 3Ds have the same name. 

I guess yes - even though everything 3D in included in 3D, still the errors now says that

- Basically double definition.

I think, at this point, it's easiest to have 
just one wrapper file.
This will make things easier.








Deleting unnecessary files from L-BFGS-B solver. Check this is okay or not.


















Weird: you have to run devtools::document() first
It will give errors
Then 
git restore R/RcppExports.R
Then it will be okay!!!!!

devtools::check()
