To compare with the DIPSynMRI, run both Step 1 and Step 2 
with `DEEP_LEARNING_COMPARE <- TRUE` in the R file. 

To get results without the Deep Learning, run only the R file 
as in Step 2 after the Step 1.a, which contains a sample dataset also.

Step 3 is for Variance Estimation of ROI example. 
A contrast vector is presentated as a dataset: 
phantom_1.0mm_msles1_gray_matter.mnc.gz


Step 1: 
a) First, clone the repository https://github.com/StatPal/DeepSynMRI to get 
the code of DeepSynMRI along with a dataset 
(obtained from brainweb interface with training data with 1% noise 
and test dataset without any noise).
b) After creating a virtual environment as instructed in the README file of the github 
repository; create folders named `DL_smooth` and `LS-py` inside the same directory. 
c) Then run the example file `SE_example_DL.py` to save the final files using 
`python SE_example_DL.py` or using any equivalent method. 


Step 2: 
a) In R, to install the package use 
```{R}
devtools::install_github("StatPal/symR@R")
```
b) Install r-reticulate and install some package using: 
```{R}
install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)
py_install("nibabel")
py_install("skimage")
```
c) Run `image_SE_1.R` 

Options: DEEP_LEARNING_COMPARE <- TRUE will add the comparison of DL and AECM and other methods

Step 3: Run
